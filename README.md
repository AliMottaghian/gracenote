Some notes:
1- I'm using Jest, Enzyme, enzyme-to-JSON for unit testing

2- I haven't used Redux in this task, because,  I believe there is no need to have a global state in this app. So, I've avoided unnecessary codes and keep the app as simple as possible.

3- Another way to solve this assignment was to using JSON-server as a fake API server. With that, we could simulate API calling and backend server. But using that was nothing more than a show-off. So, As you mentioned, I've tried to see this task as a production level of coding.
